# Multi-Marginal Schrödinger Bridges (MMDSBM)

Official PyTorch implementation of **Iterative Markovian Fitting for Multi-Marginal Schrödinger Bridges**,  
developed as part of the thesis Dynamical Multi-Marginal
Schrödinger Bridge
Application to Video Generation from Static and Unpaired Data

This repository provides both the **theoretical extension** of Schrödinger bridges to the multi-marginal case 
and a **practical implementation** that scales from toy 2D problems to high-dimensional biological and image datasets.
